# Blackjack-game

Game Link: 

Hi, my name is Zishan. It's a poker Blackjack Game I built at scrimba. 

The game has been modified a bit, and a PLAY AGAIN button has been added, which simply refreshes the page.
When the button was clicked, the array should be cleared of all items. But I couldn't figure out how to do it, so I made it refresh the page, which works for now.

    *** I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me HOW TO clear the array. ***

thank you for reading😊😍
